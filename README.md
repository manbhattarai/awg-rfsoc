## An arbitrary waveform generator with the Real Digital RFSoC board.<br>

The FPGA on the device can be loaded with $2^{19}$ points and it can generate arbitrary waveform at a sampling rate of 9.34 GSps.<br>
The jupyter notebook included here provides some information on how the arbitrary wavefrom generation is implemented in the FPGA and how it can be programmed.<br>
The block diagram of the system is shown in design_2.pdf.<br><br>
To use it copy all the files onto a folder in the RFSoC device and execute the jupyter notebook.
